      <p>I'm a full stack web developer and a junior programmer. I'm trying to learn various fields related to programming rather than specializing in a single field. You might say I'm a sort of "jack of all trades, master of none".</p>
      <p>As for my personality, I'm very flexible and can adapt to new environments and situations with ease, <span class="silver">like a cat taking the shape of a container</span>.</p>

      <p>When I encounter a problem, I always land on my feet and I don't give up that easily.</p>
      <p>I'm currently studying English literature in university and I like writing, not necessarily novels but more technical stuff like explaining a thing or an idea thoroughly without missing a detail.</p>
      <p>Just as writing detailed explanations, I also like to analyze stuff and learn how do they work or find solutions about how it can be improved.</p>
      <p>Things that I don't appreciate are: ambiguity and taking risks. When I'm doing something, I want to be exactly sure about the outcome, I don't like taking chances.</p>

      <p>I mainly post my works to either GitHub or CodePen, for formal stuff I use LinkedIn. I also have accounts on Instagram and Twitter but I don't use them actively, so putting them on this section would be useless.</p>
