      <p>Hi, my name is Alper. I'm a web developer and a junior programmer. This is my personal website. Here, you can find my works, get <span style="font-size: 0.6rem;"> little</span> information about me or contact to me indirectly.</p>
      <p>My works consist of front-end designs, back-end projects and cross-platform applications. I'm trying to learn various fields related to programming rather than specializing in a single field.</p>
