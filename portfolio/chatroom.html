        <p>A basic chat room, made with long polling technique.</p>
        <p>This project was one of my first projects to learn the relation between client-side and server-side. Originally wanted to make it with <dcg dcg-temp="link" dcg-tobj='{"href":"https://blog.stackpath.com/websocket/", "title":"websocket"}' dcg-tren></dcg> but couldn't because of the limitations of shared hosting.</p>

        <h3>What is the difference between short and long polling?</h3>
        <p>Point of the polling in general is getting data from a server continously. Short-polling requests data every pre-determined time while long-polling waits for server to send the data. Since the connection between client and server isn't aborted in long-polling, its clearly a more robust solution than short-polling.</p>
