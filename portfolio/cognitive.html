        <p>CognitiveJS (previously called DCG) is a JavaScript framework/library, broadly inspired by <span data-prop="temp:'link', data:'section.project.links.knockout as _link'"></span>.</p>
        <p>As I mentioned on the above, Cognitive is the successor of DCG. The main difference between two is, DCG is made as a pre-processing framework while Cognitive can be used both as a pre-processing framework or as a library.</p>
        <p>Other than this main difference, many features has been added to Cognitive that cannot be made in DCG, such as binding. And of course, it also has increased performance.</p>
        <p>The usage of the binding system is inspired by Knockout but has completely different structure, as it suppose to be.</p>
        <p>One of the other thing that I wanted to do is, a proper project identity. As you can see on the repository of the DCG, name of it doesn't really stick to it, and hell I didn't even bother making a logo for it. But now it has a better name that go well with the project itself and a logo (first 3 letters of Cognitive inside a cogwheel) which is a cheap attempt but that'll do for now.</p>
