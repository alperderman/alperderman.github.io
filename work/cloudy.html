            <p>The latest design of the website that I made with Grayshift framework. Name of the design comes from the background I've found from <a href="https://bgjar.com">BGJar <i class="linkify icon"></i></a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Keeping the "another year another design" tradition but this time there is a justifiable reason for that. The reason is mainly about Vue and the standalone version of the DCG. I didn't want to use Vue in this design mostly because I dont use Vue as expected to be used in the first place.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As you can see, Vue is used on web projects that has many front-end interactions but since I only used it to make static websites, it basically made things uselessly complex.</p>
            <br>
            <p>And after the only feature of the Vue that I used properly (which is templates) left a stale taste, I decided to make my own template script.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I have added the different features to this template script, and it slowly became the standalone version of the DCG.</p>
            <br>
            <p>After I made it stable enough to be used, I started to gather new ideas and search for a new CSS framework for the new design. Couple of quick searches later I found 3 frameworks that are similar in an appealing way; <a href="https://www.gethalfmoon.com">Halfmoon <i class="linkify icon"></i></a>, <a href="https://grayshift.io">Grayshift <i class="linkify icon"></i></a> and <a href="https://luxacss.com">Luxa <i class="linkify icon"></i></a>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Halfmoon is a framework oriented in dashboards, it has many great components to work on with. Luxa is a framework mostly focused on simplicity and lastly Grayhift is just like Luxa but has more utility classes.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Since I was making a personal website Halfmoon wasn't a great choice, so out of Luxa and Grayshift I decided to settle on the one that has more features.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I really like the utility classes of Grayshift, quantity of them are neither too much like Tailwind nor too little like Luxa just on point to customize to fit your needs, and since the components are declared in a way that is simple, I must say using it was a pleasant experience.</p>
