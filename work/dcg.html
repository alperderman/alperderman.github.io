            <p>Dynamic Content Generation (DCG) is a front-end solution for content management. This solution is the reason how you can read this right now. Main point of the solution is splitting the content from the interface.</p>

            <br>
            <p>In before I've tried to make this solution with <span class="text-muted">Vue</span>, it did kinda work but it had flaws and it was so complex to be actually useful. After that I have decided that I should make this from scratch.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>The Logic Behind It</h3>
            <br>
            <p>In my previous attempt, it was basically requests the content from other page and parses it on a specified place. This approach came with couple of flaws mainly about the <span class="text-muted">Search Engine Optimization (SEO)</span>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>On this new version, rather than requesting the content, it is requesting the interface and combines it with the content, since the contents are in the initial page Crawlers can easily index the page thus resolves the <span class="text-muted">SEO</span> problem.</p>
            <br>
            <p>But it doesn't stops here, this approach also provides handful of benefits such as being able to use the same interface for multiple pages, for example this page's interface is used for all the other projects only thing that changes is the content.</p>

            <h3>Features</h3>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li><span class="text-muted">Displaying JSON objects:</span> Just like Vue's data object or Mustache, but compared to the Vue its not reactive meaning that you cannot change them after the render, for this reason I call them tokens because they are basically one-way objects</li>
              <li><span class="text-muted">Looping through the JSON objects:</span> For example you can define a loop inside a HTML table that it will render JSON contents as rows Thus prevents code duplication and increases the maintainability</li>
              <li><span class="text-muted">Dynamic templates:</span> Templates are referenced on the design page and can be rendered on anywhere either with JavaScript or with using HTML attributes. They are dynamic because you can define different dataset as tokens for every single iteration of the same template.</li>
              <li><span class="text-muted">Fetching external resources:</span> It can be anything from APIs to raw HTML contents or even templates, you can always fetch them with a single HTML attribute.</li>
              <li><span class="text-muted">No fiddling around with JavaScript:</span> All of the contents and templates are indicated with HTML attributes so you don't have to write a single line of JavaScript other than executing the render.</li>
              <li><span class="text-muted">Theoritically it can work with other frameworks:</span> I didn't test it but since the solution acts like a preproccesor, it doesn't effect the execution flow so it should work with other frameworks.</li>
              <li><span class="text-muted">IE 11 support:</span> I had to add a few polyfills to support IE 11 but it definitely worth it.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr>
            <h3>Future Goals</h3>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>CMS dashboard for editing the contents directly</li>
            </ul>
