            <p>Proof of concept dashboard made with UAS, DCG and Halfmoon framework.</p>
            <br>
            <p>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/alperderman/halfmoon-dashboard">Source <i class="linkify icon"></i></a></p>
            <br>
            <p>After I managed to put UAS and DCG in a stable state, I wanted to test both of them in a project. At the same time there was a front-end framework that I really wanted to use, which was <a href="https://github.com/halfmoonui/halfmoon">Halfmoon <i class="linkify icon"></i></a>.</p>
            <p>One of the key feature of the Halfmoon that I've mentioned in the past is, that it was made for making dashboards. With that in mind, making a dashboard was the perfect way to test out the capabilities of the projects.</p>
            <p>In the making of the dashboard, I really liked the agnostic structure of the UAS. I only have to fiddle with a single table for assigning a permission to an user. The only thing that made me hesitate was the <a href="https://github.com/bcosca/fatfree/">Fat-free <i class="linkify icon"></i></a> framework dependency, which I only used for routing for the AJAX requests. I'm planning to remove it from the project as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>I have also realized that the DCG needs a much more polishing than I've previously thought. I've changed the render priority, removed some useless pieces of codes and changed the way of how templates are stored and rendered.</p>
            <p>Even though DCG is currently more stable than ever, these changes didn't satisfy me enough so I have come to a conclusion that I need to rewrite the whole DCG in a more concise way. This is my next goal for the 2022.</p>
