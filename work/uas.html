            <p>Standalone account management and authorization project.</p>

            <br>
            <p>I decided to make this project when I realized coding the same login system from scratch wastes so much time and I thought that I need an agnostic user management system that can be applied to any project without too much hassle.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Authorization is the key element of every back-end web project and if you are a developer, one way or another, your path will come across a project that needs authorization such as dashboards with a login system.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Making an authorization system is relatively easy but of course it depends on what features you want and what kind of project you are making. For instance, if you are making a project that needs just a simple password to protect the contents viewed by others, you don't even need a database for that. But if you are making a project like a forum, where multiple users interact with the different parts of the project, then things can get complex very easily.</p>
            <br>
            <p>For this reason and for the sake of simplicity, seperating account management from your main project is the best way to assure the safety of your main project.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The other benefit of seperating account management is, you can use the same authorization system on a different project. And this project aims just that.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The project contains base functions for logging in, creating a new user, deleting the existing user. And aside from the basic authorization, it also has a groups and permissions system. With defining just one function, you can check whether the user has the qualified permission or not.</p>
